<h2>Architecture</h2>
There are 1 controller and 2 repositories: EmployeeController, EmployeeRepository, StateLogRepository </br>
StateLog is used for logging stage changes of employees</br>
There is one-to-many relation between Employee and StateLog</br>
Project uses Spring Boot, H2 as database </br>
Spring State Machine 2.2.3 is used for the state management </br>
Project JDK is Amazon corretto-11 </br>

<h2>Business Rules</h2>
- Employee can be created with required fields : first name, last name, email, passport number </br>
- Employee's optional fields : address, age </br>
- Employees can't be added under the age 18 </br>
- Employee can't be deleted or updated except state changes </br>
- Employee's first name and last name length should be between 2 and 100 characters </br>
- Employee's email and passport number fields are unique to prevent creating same employee </br>

- Employee states can be : ADDED, IN_CHECK, APPROVED, ACTIVE, SECURITY_CHECK_STARTED, SECURITY_CHECK_FINISHED, WORK_PERMIT_CHECK_STARTED, WORK_PERMIT_CHECK_FINISHED </br>
- Employee events can be triggered by changeState Post Method with the string event name in request body </br>
- Allowed events are : BEGIN_CHECK, ACTIVATE, FINISH_SECURITY_CHECK, FINISH_WORK_PERMIT_CHECK </br>
- After triggering BEGIN_CHECK event, employee state updates to IN_CHECK state </br>
- After triggering FINISH_SECURITY_CHECK and FINISH_WORK_PERMIT_CHECK, employee state automatically updates to APPROVED </br>
- After triggering ACTIVATE event, employee state updates to final ACTIVE event </br>
- Employee state can't be changed after ACTIVE state </br>
